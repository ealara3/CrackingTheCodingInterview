In teh book Cracking the coding interview, Chapter 1 problem 1.5 page 91 is
the next problem we will try to solve.

The ploblem is saying that we receive a word and the other needs to be either
the same or have only one change.

We want to check is it has only one change. 

We can apply some data structure in this case.

There are several way to aproach this problem
 I will use something simple with only arrays.
It has a counter to check if the similities and always hast to have one less
 than the other one.
