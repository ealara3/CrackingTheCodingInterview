This is chapter 1 problem 3 from the book Cracking the coding interview.

This problem has a difficulty in the transition of the characters after each
%20 placed.

The problem just ask about placing %20 at the spaces.

The spaces has a value, so each time it is found that value a %20 will be
placed.

If the string was made up of arrays it will be fine.
