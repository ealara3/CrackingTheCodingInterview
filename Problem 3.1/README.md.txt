This problem was found in the book Cracking the Coding Interview Chapter 3 problem 3.1 page 98.

The way I thought this problem was by using a sinlge array for 3 type of different stacks.

The goal for this problem is to avoid the array to make two stacks colide between them.

The way I planning to approach this problem is by using 3 indexes to keep track of each stack

The problem will be when it sometimes (the stack) collide.
