This problem is in chapter 2 problem 2.2 page 94

The problem is to just find the kth number form a linked list from the back to the front.

The goal is to find the numbers at certain index.

Normally I would use make a while loop to find the size of the list and then substract form the number given and that's the index from the front to the back.

In this code I took avantage from the java import and just make it easer.

It worked with several tries.
