This is a C program which solves the Chapter 1 problem 1.1 form the book
Cracking the coding interview.

The steps I used were:

Think the problem as find a string has unique characters using arrays.

Create an array and place the character according to the ASCII code.

How the program will run is before a character was placed in the array, has to
be check if it is empty, if not then is not unique.


There were no bugs found by me in my code.
