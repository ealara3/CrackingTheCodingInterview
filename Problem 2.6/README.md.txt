This problem is on the book Cracking the Coding Interview Chapter 2 problem 2.6 page 95

What the problem is asking is if it is palindrome(if it is the same from the head to tail and from the tail to the head.)

The goal is to see check if has the same values as palindrome.

In the code I did, I used the Importation of a linked list which acts as different linkedlist.
In a regular linked list (or in an interview) I would use a doubly linkedlist.
one pointing head and the other tail and just check if it is the same.

it will work with any kind of number.
