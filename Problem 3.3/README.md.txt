This problem is in the book Cracking the problem interview Chapter 3 problem 3.3 page 99.

The begining of this problems is telling something that I didn't understand and I didn't know if we had to implement it in this lab either.

All what I understood about this problem is to include a method to the stack that can pop at what ever index.

The goal is to pop at what ever index is given.

The way I am planing to solve this, is by using the code I did in problem one and use that linked list implementation and just remove it from the stack.

This will work for what ever element is implemented.
