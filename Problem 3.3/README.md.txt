This problem is in the book Cracking the problem interview Chapter 3 problem 3.3 page 99.

What the problem is asking is to, (once one stack is full and creat another stack) it need to pop a certain stack.

The problem is asking to reach a certain stack.

How I plan to reach a problem is by making a switch statement, that if it is planned to pop the fourth stack, then it goes and pop that certain stack.

This will work for what ever element is implemented.
