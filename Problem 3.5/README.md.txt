This problem is form the book Cracking the coding interview Chapter 3 problem 3.5 pace 99.

This problem was asking the sorting of integers form the smallest to biggest by only using stacks and some variables.

The goal for this problem is to efficiently this stack from top to button.

How I plan to do it is by just comparing one pop with the next value and while is bigger that the one was pop before it will be pushed in a stack.

After there were not more bigger the one was poped first it will be pushed.

I have two problems, at the begining I wasn't able to return the new stack so I had to push to the old stack.

Now, the second problem is that it is reversed.
