This problem is a tempt of solving the Chapter 1 question 1.6 from the book
Cracking the coding interview.

The problem makes to change an array to the form but instead but replace the
repetitions of the character by the number of repetitions leavng one character
left.

We want to have a character then a number.

Two for loops will be able to solve this problem by only checking each time a
character is changed. The other for loop will count to see how many
repetitions are in it.

Problem, I am not able to change the character. 

Solving this problem will make it work.
