This problem was got it from the book Cracking the Coding Interview Chapter 3 problem 3.2 page 98.

The problem is asking for the creation of the push, pop, and min method that runs in O(1).

The goal is to create the methods in that running time.
The way the stack will be implemented is by using linkedlist implementation.
I will use a variable that is in track of the smallest number.

This will work with any number(negatives as well).
