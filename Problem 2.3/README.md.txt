This problem is in the book Cracking the coding interview Chapter 3 problem 2.3 page 94.

The problem is simply asking to remove a character form the linked list.

The goal is to find the Node where the character is before going to that node so it is able to remove.

Normally it would search for the ls.next.c and then just destroy the node. 

I took advantage of the importation of LinkedList at java and just delete the index.

It works with every entry I posted.

(In an interview I eithers ask if we are able to use this utility or just use a normal linked list.)
